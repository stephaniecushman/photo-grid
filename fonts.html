<p>Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you <span>imagine</span> that, the text of your next webpage?! I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable. I know words. I have the best words. Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't.

Look at these words. Are they small words? I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. It’s about making placeholder text great again. That’s what people want, they want placeholder text to be great again. Lorem Ipsum better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website. You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life.</p>
